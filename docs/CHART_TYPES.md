## Foundational Concepts

Before diving into chart types, it's essential to understand the fundamental choices that affect *any* chart.

### Tropical vs Sidereal Zodiac

**Tropical Zodiac:**
- Anchored to the seasons (0° Aries = Vernal Equinox)
- Dominant in Western astrology
- The zodiac "moves" relative to the fixed stars (~1° per 72 years due to precession)

**Sidereal Zodiac:**
- Anchored to the fixed stars
- Dominant in Vedic (Jyotish) astrology
- Currently ~24° behind tropical (the "ayanamsa")

```text
Sidereal Position ≈ Tropical Position - Ayanamsa
Example: Tropical Sun at 15° Aries ≈ Sidereal Sun at ~21° Pisces
```

**Ayanamsa Variants:**
- Lahiri (most common in India, official government standard)
- Krishnamurti
- Raman
- Fagan-Bradley (Western sidereal)
- Galactic Center (experimental)

**When It Matters:**
The choice is fundamental and non-negotiable within each tradition. Mixing systems creates interpretive chaos.

### House Systems

House systems divide the celestial sphere into twelve sectors. They agree on the *what* (dividing space around the native) but disagree on the *how*.

**Quadrant-Based Systems (divide the angles):**

| System | Method | Best For |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Placidus | Temporal divisions of semi-arcs | Most popular in modern Western; struggles at high latitudes |
| Koch | Birth place's house cusps at ASC degree | Similar to Placidus with different cusp positions |
| Regiomontanus | Celestial equator divisions projected | Horary tradition (William Lilly) |
| Campanus | Prime vertical divisions | Spatial/local emphasis |
| Porphyry | Trisection of quadrants | Simple; good for high latitudes |
| Alcabitius | Similar to Porphyry with semi-arc adjustment | Medieval tradition |
| Topocentric | Observer-centric refinement of Placidus | Precision-focused modern use |

**Non-Quadrant Systems:**

| System | Method | Best For |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Whole Sign | Each sign = one house, ASC sign = 1st | Hellenistic revival; Vedic astrology |
| Equal House | 30° from ASC for each cusp | Simplicity; high latitudes |
| Equal (MC) | 30° divisions centered on MC | MC-focused equal variant |
| Morinus | Equator-based, ignores ecliptic | Theoretical interest |

**The House System Debate:**

There is no universally "correct" house system. The choice often reflects:
- Tradition (Hellenistic → Whole Sign; Medieval → Regiomontanus; Modern → Placidus)
- Latitude (polar regions break quadrant systems)
- Philosophical orientation (fate vs. psychology; space vs. time)

**Practical Recommendation:** Learn one system deeply before comparing. Whole Sign offers conceptual clarity; Placidus offers nuance for intermediate house cusps.

## The Natal Chart

### What Is a Natal Chart?

The natal chart (also: nativity, radix, birth chart, geniture) maps the heavens at the moment of first breath from the perspective of the birth location. It is the foundational chart in horoscopic astrology.

**Required Data:**
- Date of birth
- Time of birth (ideally to the minute)
- Location of birth (latitude/longitude)

**Without Birth Time:**
- Solar chart (Sun placed on ASC) — crude approximation
- Noon chart — planets approximately correct, houses meaningless
- Sunrise chart — traditional alternative

### Chart Components

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Rectification

When birth time is unknown or uncertain, **rectification** uses life events to work backward to the correct time.

**Methods:**
- Primary directions to angles matching major life events
- Progressed angles to natal planets
- Solar arc directions
- Transits to angles during pivotal moments
- Physical appearance correlating to ASC sign (unreliable alone)

**Tools:** Rectification requires testing multiple potential times against known biographical data.

---

## Progressed & Directed Charts

Progression and direction techniques "move" the natal chart forward in symbolic time to reveal unfolding developmental themes.

### Secondary Progressions

**The Core Principle:** One day of planetary motion after birth = one year of life.

```text
Progressed chart for age 30 = chart cast for 30 days after birth
```

**What Moves:**
- All planets progress (Sun ~1° per year, Moon ~1° per month)
- Angles progress in most systems
- Progressed Moon is the primary timer (~2.5 years per sign)

**Interpretation Focus:**
- Internal development, psychological evolution
- Progressed aspects to natal planets
- Progressed planets changing signs
- Progressed New and Full Moons

**Progressed Lunation Cycle:**

```text
Progressed New Moon  → New 30-year cycle begins
Progressed Crescent  → Emergence, struggle
Progressed First Q   → Crisis in action
Progressed Gibbous   → Analysis, refinement  
Progressed Full Moon → Culmination, awareness
Progressed Dissem.   → Sharing, teaching
Progressed Last Q    → Crisis in consciousness
Progressed Balsamic  → Release, endings
```

### Tertiary Progressions

**Principle:** One day = one lunar month.

**Use Case:** Faster-moving timer than secondary progressions; useful for fine-tuning timing within a progressed year.

### Minor Progressions

**Principle:** One lunar month = one year.

**Use Case:** Rarely used; some astrologers find it useful for emotional timing.

### Converse Progressions

**Principle:** Count backward from birth instead of forward.

```text
Converse progressed chart for age 30 = chart cast for 30 days BEFORE birth
```

**Philosophy:** Accesses pre-incarnational themes, karmic inheritance, or the "unlived life" running parallel to conscious development.

**Application:** Compare direct and converse progressed charts; where they converge, themes intensify.

### Primary Directions

**The Oldest Technique:** Used since Ptolemy. Based on the diurnal rotation of the Earth.

**Principle:** Approximately 1° of right ascension along the celestial equator = 1 year of life.

```text
When a directed planet reaches a natal angle (or vice versa),
a corresponding life event manifests.
```

**Key Variants:**
- Ptolemaic (semi-arc method)
- Regiomontanus (under-the-pole)
- Placidian (temporal house-based)

**Characteristics:**
- Angles and their directed aspects are paramount
- More "fateful" in interpretation than secondary progressions
- Preferred by traditional astrologers for major life events

### Solar Arc Directions

**Principle:** All planets and points advance at the Sun's progressed rate (~1° per year).

```text
Solar Arc at age 45 ≈ Natal positions + 45°
```

**Advantages:**
- Simple to calculate
- Outer planets "move" meaningfully (unlike progressions)
- Popular in modern predictive work

**Interpretation:**
- Solar arc planet conjunct natal planet/angle = activation of both
- Use tight orbs (0°30' – 1°)

### Degree-for-a-Year (Symbolic Directions)

**Principle:** Each planet advances exactly 1° per year.

**Variants:**
- Naibod rate (59'08" per year — mean Sun motion)
- Degree-for-a-year (exactly 1°)

**Use Case:** Simplified primary directions; easy mental math.

---

## Return Charts

Return charts mark the moment a planet returns to its exact natal position, initiating a new cycle.

### Solar Return

**Definition:** The chart cast for the moment the transiting Sun returns to its exact natal degree and minute. Marks the astrological "birthday."

**Key Considerations:**

| Factor | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Location | Cast for *where you are* at the moment, not birth location (debated) |
| Precessed vs. Non-Precessed | Some use tropical return; some precess to sidereal natal Sun |
| Validity Period | Sunrise-to-sunrise (some) or moment-to-moment (most) |

**Interpretation Priorities:**
1. SR Ascendant sign and ruler
2. SR Sun house placement
3. Planets on SR angles
4. SR Moon sign and house
5. SR chart aspects
6. SR planets conjunct natal planets/angles

**Relocation Controversy:**
Some astrologers travel for better solar returns. Critics argue the birth location should always be used. The jury remains out; experiment for yourself.

### Lunar Return

**Definition:** Monthly chart when the Moon returns to its natal position (~27.3 days).

**Use Case:** 
- Emotional themes for the month
- Short-term timing within solar return year
- Particularly relevant for Moon-ruled charts (Cancer ASC)

**Interpretation:** Focus on:
- LR Ascendant and Moon house
- Aspects to LR Moon
- Which natal houses are activated

### Planetary Returns

Each planet's return marks a cycle of that planet's archetypal domain.

| Planet | Cycle | Significance |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Mercury | ~1 year | Mental/communication themes (3 returns/year due to retrogrades) |
| Venus | ~1 year | Relationship, value, aesthetic themes (similar complexity) |
| Mars | ~2 years | Action, assertion, conflict cycles |
| Jupiter | ~12 years | Expansion, belief, opportunity cycles (ages 12, 24, 36...) |
| Saturn | ~29.5 years | Maturation, responsibility, structure (ages 29-30, 58-60) |
| Uranus | ~84 years | Liberation, awakening (usually once per lifetime) |
| Neptune | ~165 years | (No personal return) |
| Pluto | ~248 years | (No personal return) |

**Saturn Return Special Note:**

```text
First Saturn Return (~29-30)  → Adulthood, life structure solidifies
Second Saturn Return (~58-60) → Elderhood, legacy assessment
Third Saturn Return (~88-90)  → Rare; final integration
```

The Saturn Return is among the most reliable and profound transits. Cast a chart for the exact moment and interpret as you would a solar return.

### Demi-Returns and Quarter Returns

**Demi-Return (Opposition):** Planet opposes its natal position.

```text
Saturn demi-return (~age 14-15) → Adolescent rebellion against structure
Jupiter demi-return (~age 6, 18, 30...) → Re-evaluation of beliefs
```

**Quarter Returns (Squares):** Opening and closing squares in the cycle.

```text
Saturn opening square (~age 7) → First tests of structure
Saturn closing square (~age 22) → Preparation for first return
```

**Use Case:** Understanding the full planetary cycle, not just the return.

### Progressed Solar Return

**Definition:** Solar return calculated for the *progressed* Sun's position rather than natal.

**Principle:** Blends progression and return techniques.

**Use Case:** Advanced timing; rarely used but theoretically coherent.

## Relationship Charts

### What Are Relationship Charts?

Relationship charts create a single chart representing the relationship *as its own entity* — not the interaction between two people (that's synastry), but the relationship itself as a third thing that emerges from the union.

### Synastry (Reference)

Synastry is not a chart but a comparison: one chart overlaid on another.

```text
Person A's Mars conjunct Person B's Venus
→ Analysis of interaction, not a new chart
```

**Include here for context:** Synastry shows how two people *affect each other*; composite/Davison shows what the relationship *is*.

### Composite Charts

**Method:** Calculate the midpoint of each planet pair between two natal charts.

```text
Composite Sun = midpoint(Person A's Sun, Person B's Sun)
Composite Moon = midpoint(Person A's Moon, Person B's Moon)
... and so on for all planets
```

**Characteristics:**
- Mathematical construct (no actual moment in time)
- Typically rendered house-less (no meaningful Ascendant)
- Focuses on planetary aspects within the composite
- Popular in modern psychological astrology

**Schools of Thought:**

| School | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| Hand/Arroyo | Pure midpoints, no houses, aspect-focused |
| Derived Angles | Use midpoint ASC/MC as derived angles, add houses |
| Reference Location | Calculate houses for a meaningful location (city where couple met, lives, etc.) |

**The Near/Far Midpoint Problem:**

Every two points have two midpoints (180° apart). Standard practice uses the *near* midpoint. Some astrologers consider both.

```text
Person A's Sun at 10° Aries
Person B's Sun at 20° Libra
Near midpoint: 0° Cancer or 0° Capricorn (180° apart)
Standard: Use the shorter arc → 0° Cancer
```

### Davison Relationship Chart

**Method:** Find the midpoint in both *time* and *space* between two birth events, then cast a real chart for that moment and place.

```text
Davison DateTime = midpoint(Person A's birth time, Person B's birth time)
Davison Location = midpoint(Person A's birth place, Person B's birth place)
```

**Characteristics:**
- Represents an actual astronomical moment
- Has a real Ascendant and house system
- Can be progressed and directed like any natal chart
- Developed by Ronald Davison in the 1970s

**Geographic Midpoint Methods:**

| Method | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Simple Average | `(lat1 + lat2) / 2, (lon1 + lon2) / 2` | Fast; acceptable for nearby locations |
| Great Circle Midpoint | True geodesic midpoint on Earth's surface | Accurate for any distance |

**Which to Use — Composite or Davison?**

| Factor | Composite | Davison |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Houses | Problematic/derived | Natural, valid |
| Progression | Cannot truly progress | Can progress/direct |
| Philosophy | Symbolic/psychological | Concrete/temporal |
| Transit responsiveness | Transits to midpoints | Transits to real positions |

**Recommendation:** Use both. They reveal different facets of the relationship.

### Multi-Person Composites

Composite technique extends to groups:

```text
Family composite = midpoints of all family members
Business partnership = midpoints of all partners
```

**Caveat:** Interpretation becomes more abstract with more people. Focus on tight aspects and emphasized houses.

### Coalescent Charts

**Alternative to Composite:** Instead of midpoints, use the *harmonics* of combined charts.

**Rarely Used:** Primarily of theoretical interest in harmonic astrology circles.

## Horary Charts

### What Is Horary Astrology?

Horary ("of the hour") is the art of answering a specific question by casting a chart for the moment the question is asked and understood by the astrologer.

**Philosophical Basis:** The moment of sincere inquiry contains the answer. The universe reflects the querent's situation at the moment of asking.

### Casting a Horary Chart

**Required Elements:**
- Exact time the astrologer understands the question
- Location of the astrologer (traditional) or querent (modern variant)
- A sincere, specific question

```text
"Should I accept the job offer from Company X?" ✓
"What does my future hold?" ✗ (too vague)
```

### Strictures Against Judgment

Traditional horary recognizes "warning signs" that the chart may not be readable:

| Stricture | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Saturn in 7th | Astrologer hindered; judgment impaired |
| Moon void of course | Nothing will come of the matter; no action |
| Early Ascendant (0-3°) | Too early to ask; situation not yet ripe |
| Late Ascendant (27-30°) | Too late; matter already decided |
| Via Combusta Moon (15° Libra – 15° Scorpio) | Difficulty seeing clearly |

**Modern Practice:** Many astrologers note strictures but don't automatically refuse judgment. Context matters.

### Key Horary Significators

```text
Querent (the one asking)    → 1st house ruler, Moon
Quesited (the thing asked)  → House ruler based on topic

Marriage question:           7th house ruler = partner
Career question:             10th house ruler = career
Lost object:                 2nd house ruler = possessions
```

### Horary House System

**Traditional Preference:** Regiomontanus (William Lilly's choice)

**Modern Alternatives:** Placidus, Whole Sign (some contemporary practitioners)

### Decumbiture Charts

**A Specialized Horary:** Cast for the moment a person falls ill ("takes to their bed").

**Use:** Medical astrology; prognosis and treatment timing.

---

## Electional Charts

### What Is Electional Astrology?

Electional astrology selects optimal times to begin activities — the inverse of horary (which reads a given moment) and natal (which interprets a past moment).

**Principle:** Beginnings contain endings. Choose auspicious conditions for the "birth" of an enterprise.

### Key Electional Considerations

**General Principles:**

| Factor | Ideal Condition |
|--------|-----------------|
| Moon | Waxing (for growth), applying to benefics, not void |
| Ascendant ruler | Dignified, unafflicted, angular |
| Malefics (Mars, Saturn) | Cadent (3, 6, 9, 12) if possible |
| Benefics (Venus, Jupiter) | Angular (1, 4, 7, 10) |
| Mercury | Direct (especially for contracts, communication) |
| Retrograde planets | Avoid in houses relevant to the matter |

**Topic-Specific Considerations:**

```text
Marriage:        Venus and 7th house emphasized; Moon applying to benefics
Business launch: 10th and 2nd house strong; Jupiter well-placed
Surgery:         Moon not in the sign ruling the body part; Mars controlled
Travel:          9th house unafflicted; avoid Moon in fixed signs
```

### Practical Limits

Perfect elections rarely exist. Electional astrology prioritizes:
1. Most critical factors for the matter
2. Avoiding the worst configurations
3. Accepting compromises on lesser points

### Inceptional Charts

Once an event occurs, its "birth chart" can be analyzed like a nativity:

- **Business incorporation chart** — the company's "natal chart"
- **Wedding chart** — the marriage's chart
- **First meeting chart** — the relationship's inception
- **Contract signing** — the agreement's chart

---

## Mundane Charts

Mundane ("worldly") astrology applies chart techniques to nations, governments, historical events, and collective phenomena.

### Ingress Charts

**Definition:** Charts cast for the Sun's entry into cardinal signs.

| Ingress | Date | Significance |
|---------|------|--------------|
| Aries Ingress | ~March 20 | Most important; the astrological new year; sets tone for the year |
| Cancer Ingress | ~June 21 | Summer Solstice; mid-year check |
| Libra Ingress | ~September 22 | Autumn Equinox |
| Capricorn Ingress | ~December 21 | Winter Solstice |

**How to Read:**
- Cast for a nation's capital
- Angles and angular planets show major themes
- 10th house = government, leadership
- 4th house = the people, land, opposition

**Duration Rules (traditional):**
- If cardinal sign rises: valid for 3 months (to next ingress)
- If fixed sign rises: valid for 6 months
- If mutable sign rises: valid for the full year

### Lunation Charts

**New Moon Charts:** Cast for each New Moon; shows the themes for the lunar month.

**Full Moon Charts:** Culmination, revelation, tension point mid-cycle.

**Interpretation:** 
- Focus on the house containing the lunation
- Aspects to the lunation from other planets
- Ruler of the lunation sign

### Eclipse Charts

**Solar Eclipses:** New Moons that conjoin the lunar nodes; more powerful, longer-lasting effects.

**Lunar Eclipses:** Full Moons at the nodes; revelations, endings, emotional intensity.

**Eclipse Families:**
- Saros cycles group eclipses by 18-year periods
- Each Saros series carries a signature theme
- Bernadette Brady's work on eclipse interpretation is foundational

**Duration of Effect:**
- Traditional rule: 1 year of effect per hour of eclipse duration
- Modern practice: Effects peak when planets transit the eclipse degree

### Great Conjunction Charts

**Jupiter-Saturn Conjunction (~every 20 years):**
- Marks generational/political cycles
- Elemental cycle: conjunctions stay in one element for ~200 years, then shift
- 2020: Shift from Earth to Air (Aquarius) — technological/social revolution themes

**Other Great Conjunctions:**
- Saturn-Pluto: Collective reckoning, power structures (2020, 1982, 1947...)
- Jupiter-Pluto: Expansion of power, wealth extremes
- Outer planet conjunctions: Generational themes

### National Charts

Countries, like people, have birth charts.

**Examples:**
- USA (Sibley): July 4, 1776, 5:10 PM, Philadelphia — Sagittarius rising
- USA (Gemini rising variant): same date, different time
- France (Fifth Republic): October 6, 1958, 6:30 PM, Paris

**Controversies:** Many nations have disputed "birth" moments. Use the chart that works empirically with transits and progressions.

---

## Relocation & Spatial Charts

### Relocated Natal Chart

**Principle:** Recalculate the natal chart's houses for a different location, keeping planetary positions fixed.

```text
Born in New York → Relocated chart for Tokyo
Same planets, same signs, different houses and angles
```

**Use Case:** Understanding how a location activates different life areas.

**Example:**
- Natal Saturn in 6th → Relocated Saturn on MC in new city = career challenges/authority there

### Astrocartography (A*C*G)

**Developer:** Jim Lewis (1970s)

**Method:** Project planetary lines onto a world map, showing where each planet is angular.

```text
MC line:  Planet on Midheaven at that longitude
IC line:  Planet on IC (opposite MC)
ASC line: Planet rising at that latitude/longitude
DSC line: Planet setting
```

**Reading the Map:**
- Beneficial planets angular = favorable experiences
- Challenging planets angular = difficult experiences
- Crossing points (paran lines) = combined planetary influence

**Paran Lines:**
Where two planetary lines cross creates a paran — a zone of combined influence.

```text
Jupiter MC crossing Venus ASC → Expansive, pleasant, possibly lucky region
Saturn MC crossing Mars ASC → Difficult, demanding, potentially dangerous
```

### Local Space Charts

**Method:** Project planetary positions as compass directions from the birthplace, creating directional lines.

```text
Venus at 45° azimuth → Northeast direction carries Venus themes
Saturn at 180° azimuth → Due south carries Saturn themes
```

**Application:**
- Feng shui-like spatial orientation
- Choosing which direction to travel, place furniture, etc.
- Less commonly used than A*C*G but interesting for local-scale decisions

### Geodetic Charts

**Principle:** Assign 0° Aries to 0° longitude (Greenwich), with the zodiac wrapping around the Earth.

**Use:** Each location on Earth has a "natural" Ascendant and Midheaven.

**Application:** Understanding the inherent nature of a place, independent of any individual's chart.

---

## Harmonic Charts

### What Are Harmonics?

Harmonic charts multiply all planetary positions by a given number, then reduce to the zodiac circle.

```text
Harmonic position = (Natal position × Harmonic number) mod 360°
```

**Example: 5th Harmonic (H5)**
```text
Natal Sun at 72° (12° Gemini)
H5 Sun = 72° × 5 = 360° = 0° Aries
```

### Key Harmonics

| Harmonic | Meaning | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| H1 | Natal chart | Base chart |
| H2 | Opposition | Duality, conflict |
| H3 | Trine | Ease, talent |
| H4 | Square | Challenge, manifestation |
| H5 | Quintile (72°) | Creativity, talent, obsession |
| H7 | Septile (51°26') | Inspiration, the irrational, fated |
| H8 | Semi-square/sesquiquadrate | Manifestation intensified |
| H9 | Novile (40°) | Spiritual growth, gestation; related to Navamsa |
| H12 | Semi-sextile | Subtle discomfort, integration |

### Interpretation

**Conjunctions in harmonic charts** reveal hidden patterns not visible in the natal:

- Planets conjunct in H5 share creative/obsessive connection
- Planets conjunct in H7 share fated/irrational connection
- Natal chart shows the aspect only if within orb of the base angle

### Age Harmonics

**Principle:** Cast the harmonic for the current age.

```text
Age 45 → Harmonic 45 chart
```

**Use:** Timing technique; planets conjunct in the age harmonic are activated that year.

---

## Heliocentric & Alternative Perspectives

### Heliocentric Charts

**Method:** Cast the chart from the Sun's perspective rather than Earth's.

**Key Differences:**
- No Moon (Earth-Moon system becomes a single point)
- No retrograde motion (retrogrades are an Earth-observation artifact)
- No houses (no ASC without Earth location)
- Mercury and Venus can be anywhere in the zodiac (not limited to solar proximity)

**Philosophical Use:**
- The "soul's" perspective vs. the "personality's" perspective
- Some traders use heliocentric charts for market timing
- Complements geocentric; not a replacement

### Earthcentric vs. Topocentric

**Geocentric (standard):** Earth's center as observation point.

**Topocentric:** The actual birth location on Earth's surface.

**Practical Difference:** Very slight positional variations; topocentric is technically more accurate for house cusps.

### Galactic & Cosmic Reference Frames

**Galactic Center (26°–27° Sagittarius):**
- Some astrologers treat conjunctions to the GC as spiritually significant
- Associated with cosmic downloads, higher purpose

**Super Galactic Center (~2° Libra):**
- Even more speculative
- Hypothesized as related to collective/cosmic themes

---

## Vedic/Jyotish Chart Types

Jyotish (Hindu astrology) uses the sidereal zodiac and a distinct set of chart techniques.

### Rasi Chart (D1)

**The Main Chart:** Equivalent to the Western natal chart.

**Key Differences from Western:**
- Sidereal zodiac (Lahiri ayanamsa most common)
- Whole Sign houses almost universal
- Different house significators
- Different aspect system (special aspects for Mars, Jupiter, Saturn)

### Divisional Charts (Vargas)

Jyotish divides the zodiac into harmonic sub-charts for specific life areas.

| Varga | Division | Domain |
|-------|----------|--------|
| D1 (Rasi) | 1 | Overall life, body |
| D2 (Hora) | 2 | Wealth |
| D3 (Drekkana) | 3 | Siblings, courage |
| D4 (Chaturthamsa) | 4 | Property, fortune |
| D7 (Saptamsa) | 7 | Children |
| D9 (Navamsa) | 9 | Marriage, dharma, soul purpose |
| D10 (Dasamsa) | 10 | Career, actions |
| D12 (Dwadasamsa) | 12 | Parents |
| D16 (Shodasamsa) | 16 | Vehicles, comforts |
| D20 (Vimsamsa) | 20 | Spiritual practice |
| D24 (Chaturvimsamsa) | 24 | Education |
| D27 (Bhamsa) | 27 | Strengths, weaknesses |
| D30 (Trimsamsa) | 30 | Evils, misfortune |
| D40 (Khavedamsa) | 40 | Auspicious/inauspicious effects |
| D45 (Akshavedamsa) | 45 | General indications |
| D60 (Shashtiamsa) | 60 | Past life, karma |

### The Navamsa (D9) Special Status

The Navamsa is the second-most important chart after the Rasi:

- Reveals the "fruit" of the Rasi chart
- Essential for marriage analysis
- Shows the soul's deeper purpose (dharma)
- Planets weak in Rasi but strong in Navamsa can still give good results (and vice versa)

**Calculation:**
```text
Navamsa position = Planet's sign position × 9 (mapped to signs cyclically)
```

### Varshaphal (Vedic Solar Return)

**Also Called:** Tajika system, Annual Horoscopy

**Method:** Solar return chart using Jyotish techniques

**Key Features:**
- Muntha: A progressed point moving 1 sign per year from the Moon sign
- Tajika aspects (different from Parashari aspects)
- Sahams: Similar to Arabic Parts
- Year lord (Varshesh): Key timing planet

---

## Uranian & Cosmobiological Charts

### Hamburg School (Uranian Astrology)

**Founders:** Alfred Witte, Friedrich Sieggrün (early 20th century Germany)

**Key Innovations:**
- 8 hypothetical trans-Neptunian planets (Cupido, Hades, Zeus, Kronos, Apollon, Admetos, Vulcanus, Poseidon)
- Emphasis on midpoints as primary interpretation units
- 90° and 360° dial charts
- Planetary pictures: three-body midpoint equations

### The 90° Dial

**Method:** Fold the 360° chart into a 90° circle.

```text
All conjunctions, squares, and oppositions become conjunctions on the 90° dial
Semi-squares and sesquiquadrates also become conjunctions
```

**Use:** Reveals hard aspect patterns more clearly; core Uranian technique.

### Planetary Pictures

**Structure:** A = B / C (Planet A at the midpoint of B and C)

```text
Sun = Mars/Saturn → Vitality checked by discipline; focused effort
Moon = Venus/Neptune → Emotional sensitivity; artistic/romantic idealization
```

**Interpretation:** Thousands of possible combinations; lookup tables exist.

### Cosmobiology

**Developer:** Reinhold Ebertin (mid-20th century Germany)

**Relationship to Uranian:** Cosmobiology is a streamlined version:
- Uses the 90° dial and midpoint emphasis
- Rejects the hypothetical planets
- Published "The Combination of Stellar Influences" — the foundational midpoint cookbook

### 45° Dial

Further compression of the chart:
```text
45° dial brings semi-squares and sesquiquadrates into conjunction
with squares and oppositions
```

**Use:** Finding the tightest hard aspect structures.

## Draconic & Nodal Charts

### Draconic Charts

**Method:** Recalculate the natal chart with 0° Aries set to the North Node.

```text
Draconic position = Natal position - North Node position
```

**All planets shift backward by the North Node degree.**

**Interpretation:**
- The "soul chart" or pre-incarnational self
- Shows deeper karmic patterns and soul intentions
- Compare draconic planets to natal positions for insight

### Nodal Charts (True vs. Mean Node)

**Mean Node:** Mathematically smoothed; moves steadily backward through the zodiac.

**True Node:** Accounts for actual lunar wobble; can move briefly forward.

**Debate:** Most Vedic and traditional Western use mean; some modern astrologers prefer true. The difference is rarely more than 2°.

### Nodal Axis Emphasis

The Lunar Nodes (North/South) form an axis in any chart:

- **North Node (Rahu):** Future direction, growth edge, unfamiliar territory
- **South Node (Ketu):** Past patterns, innate gifts, release point

Planets conjunct either node take on karmic significance regardless of chart type.

## Fixed Star Techniques

### Conjunctions to Fixed Stars

**Method:** Note planets within 1° (or less) of major fixed stars.

**Major Fixed Stars:**

| Star | Longitude (~2025) | Nature |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| Regulus | 0° Virgo | Royal star; success, potential downfall |
| Spica | 23° Libra | Benefic; gifts, protection |
| Aldebaran | 9° Gemini | Royal star; military/intellectual success |
| Antares | 9° Sagittarius | Royal star; intensity, danger |
| Fomalhaut | 3° Pisces | Royal star; idealism, mysticism |
| Algol | 26° Taurus | Losing one's head; intensity, misfortune |
| Sirius | 14° Cancer | Brilliance, ambition, burning |

### Parans

**Method:** Rather than zodiacal longitude, track when stars rise/set/culminate relative to planets.

```text
If Jupiter rises as Spica culminates in the natal chart,
there is a paran between them regardless of zodiacal aspect.
```

**Interpretation:** Parans reveal connections based on local space rather than ecliptic position.

## Traditional Timing Techniques

### Annual Profections

**Method:** Each year of life activates a house (and its ruler) in sequence.

```text
Age 0  → 1st house
Age 1  → 2nd house
Age 2  → 3rd house
...
Age 11 → 12th house
Age 12 → 1st house again
```

**Interpretation:**
- The profected house ruler is the "Lord of the Year"
- Transits to/from the Lord of the Year are especially significant
- Planets in the profected house activate

### Monthly Profections

**Extension:** Divide the year into 12 parts; each month activates a house.

```text
Birthday month → Profected house
Birthday + 1 month → Next house
etc.
```

### Zodiacal Releasing

**Method:** A Hellenistic timing technique based on the Lot of Fortune (or Spirit).

**Procedure:**
1. Start from the Lot of Fortune sign
2. Each sign rules a period based on its planetary ruler's years
3. Sub-periods divide each major period

**Planetary Years:**

| Planet | Years |
|--------|-------|
| Sun | 19 |
| Moon | 25 |
| Mercury | 20 |
| Venus | 8 |
| Mars | 15 |
| Jupiter | 12 |
| Saturn | 27 |

**Interpretation:**
- "Peak periods" when the periods land on the Fortune ruler or angular signs
- Developed by Hellenistic astrologers; revived by Chris Brennan and others

### Decennials

**Another Hellenistic Timing System:** Based on planetary periods starting from the ASC or sect light.

**Similar to Vedic Dashas in concept, different in calculation.**

### Firdaria

**Persian Timing Technique:** Planetary periods cycling through life.

**Day births:**
```text
Sun (10 years) → Venus (8) → Mercury (13) → Moon (9) → Saturn (11)
→ Jupiter (12) → Mars (7) → North Node (3) → South Node (2) → [repeat]
```

**Night births:** Start from Moon, different order.

**Sub-periods:** Each major period divided among the planets.

## Chinese Astrological Systems

### Ba Zi (Four Pillars of Destiny)

**Components:** Year, Month, Day, Hour — each with a Stem and Branch

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Year Pillar │ Month Pillar │ Day Pillar │ Hour Pillar │
│  Stem+Branch │ Stem+Branch  │ Stem+Branch│ Stem+Branch │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Elements:**
- 10 Heavenly Stems (5 elements × Yin/Yang)
- 12 Earthly Branches (the 12 animals)

**Interpretation:**
- Day Stem = self, identity
- Relationships between pillars show life patterns
- Luck Pillars: 10-year periods derived from month pillar

**Not a "chart" in the Western sense:** More of a coded symbolic matrix than a circular diagram.

### Zi Wei Dou Shu (Purple Star Astrology)

**Method:** Map stars (not astronomical stars — symbolic points) into a 12-palace grid.

**Main Star:** Zi Wei (Purple Star/Emperor Star) — its placement determines the whole pattern.

**Palaces:** Similar to houses (Self, Siblings, Spouse, Children, Wealth, Health, Travel, Friends, Career, Property, Fortune, Parents)

**Interpretation:** 
- Stars in palaces show life tendencies
- Transformations and interactions between palaces

**Distinct Tradition:** Often considered more nuanced than Ba Zi for personality analysis.

## Notes on Software Implementation

For developers building astrological software, each chart type implies specific calculation requirements:

### Core Requirements (All Charts)
- Ephemeris access (Swiss Ephemeris recommended)
- Timezone and location database
- House system algorithms
- Aspect calculation

### By Chart Type

| Chart Type | Special Requirements |
|------------|---------------------|
| Progressions | Date offset calculation; progressed angles (Naibod or other rate) |
| Solar returns | Precise Sun longitude calculation; iterative time-finding |
| Composite | Midpoint calculation; near/far midpoint handling |
| Davison | Time midpoint; geodesic (great circle) midpoint |
| Horary | Void of course Moon detection; stricture flagging |
| Harmonic | Modular arithmetic for any harmonic |
| Astrocartography | Spherical projection; ASC/MC line calculation |
| Vedic vargas | Divisional chart mapping algorithms |
| Profections | Simple modular counting; Lord of Year identification |
